<h1>This best movie according to Priyanka  </h1>
<h2> My top 3 movie of all time </h2>
 <hr />
 <h3> 3 Idiots</h3>
   <p>  This movie is a comedy with great acting ,unique characters , a complex plot and
     most importantly a very inspiring
     movie about choosing the correct route in life  </p>

    <h4> Friends</h4>
  <P> it's not just any show. It is a very compelling, hilarious, touching and exceptional sitcom.
     This show brings various vital life lessons and a meaningful lesson about friendship. 
     The ending is flawless. All six characters are happy and have moved on with their lives.
      The acting, casting, costumes, sets and music were all exceptional.</p>  

     <h5> The Exorcist</h5>  
     <p>One of the movie's greatest assets is in the fact that the characters are fully formed and likeable. 
        Max von Sydow is introduced in the opening scene as a priest who makes a remarkable discovery: one that will haunt him until the end of the film.
         The close relationship established between Regan (Linda Blair) and her mother (Ellen Burstyn) sets the emotional foundation for the horrors to come, and Jason Miller as a former boxer-turned-priest who is taking care of his ailing mother as his own faith is slipping away provides an even bigger dramatic punch. 
         William O'Malley is also a likeable friend to Karras (Miller), and their final scene is nothing short of heartbreaking. 
        It's a cast that is fully committed to their roles, and all of the performances are absolutely gripping. </p>
